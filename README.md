# IDA-BGS-Bot
 Discord Bot for sending warnings/reports/objectives from IDA-BGS system

## What it does:  
This Bot receives JSON data packages from the [IDA-BGS API](https://github.com/ZTiKnl/IDA-BGS-API) to track faction data.  
Data is then sent the appropriate Discord channel  

## How to use:  
1. Install Node.js and NPM
2. Download files
3. Run `npm install` in the folder where the files are downloaded
4. Create a system service that runs `node /locationtofile/`  

## Changes to make for use by another faction
Want to make this work for another faction, some changes are required to the files in this repo.  

## Disclaimer
This API is still under construction, ~~bugs~~ new features WILL appear unexpectedly.  
Patches are always welcome.
